//: ## Classes, Properties and Methods
//: A class is defined just like a struct. Classes use a custom init() method that assigns member variables from the input parameters.
class Movie {
    let title: String
    let director: String

        self.title = title
        self.director = director
        self.releaseYear = releaseYear
    }
}
//: Classes can also have methods

/*
 Something that is passed by value such as an instance of a struct is copied when it's assigned to a variable or passed to a function. Changing a property on the instance will only apply to the copy, and the original instance will remain unchanged.

 Values that are passed by reference, such as instances of classes, are not copied. Changing a value on a copy will also modify the original instance, since the copy is simply referencing the original.
